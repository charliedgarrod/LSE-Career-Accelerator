2Market: Customer & Marketing Insights Dashboard
Welcome to the 2Market Analytics Project, a deep dive into customer demographics, purchasing behavior, and marketing channel effectiveness for a multinational supermarket. This project showcases a complete data workflow from raw records to business recommendations through interactive dashboards and exploratory analysis.

📌 Problem Statement
Ineffective marketing campaigns and misaligned product offerings were costing 2Market time and revenue. Without a clear view of who the customers are, what they purchase, and which ads convert, 2Market risked investing in the wrong places.
This project delivers a comprehensive solution: a set of dashboards and insights to guide smarter marketing and procurement decisions.

🧠 Analytical Approach
- Tools:
- Excel: For initial EDA and data cleaning
- SQL: For aggregation, anomaly handling, and demographic segmentation
- Tableau: For dashboard design and insight delivery
- Focus Areas:
- Demographic segmentation (age, income, education, location)
- Product-level sales trends
- Marketing channel effectiveness and conversion

📊 Key Insights
- Demographics:
- Majority of customers are over 50, with an average age of 54
- Most earn between $30,000–$40,000, and 50% hold a university degree
- 72% of customers have children; married couples with no kids spend the most
- Spending Behavior:
- Spain leads in total revenue, Montenegro in per capita spend
- Alcohol and non-vegetable items dominate sales across demographics
- Summer months show peak activity, suggesting seasonal campaign potential
- Marketing Effectiveness:
- Instagram and Twitter are top-performing channels
- Brochures had negligible conversions and should be discontinued
- USA and Montenegro, despite strong per capita spend, are under-leveraged in ads

🧭 Strategic Recommendations
- Replicate Spain’s marketing strategy in underperforming but high-potential regions (e.g., USA, Montenegro)
- Promote alcohol and ready-meal bundles via Instagram ads targeting couples
- Discontinue low-ROI channels like brochures and redirect spend to social platforms and TikTok/YouTube trials
- Investigate outlier income patterns in customers under 30 to refine segmentatio
